# Changes

This file lists the main changes of this version of the project compared to the previous version of the project. The main changes are the following:

1. The project was converted into the structure of the project templates.
2. The codes were converted to fit the `pytask` structure.
3. All codes were made reproducible by setting seeds were needed.
4. To all codes error handling and docstrings were added.
5. To all functions tests were added.
6. The code was reformatted to fit good software engeering practices including renaming variables, writing functions and subfunctions and so on.
7. The webscraping part of the project was revisited and the code greatly improved in efficiency and clarity. A new way to webscrape data was implemented.
8. A new timeframe for the data was chosen to gather new insights in the time-series analysis part of the project.
9. The code was exported into more modern versions of most libraries including the implementation of pandas most modern features, plotting done by plotly instead of matplot lib and using
 the newest version of the BeautifoulSoup library as a webscraper instead of an old version of Selenium.
10. The model training was also revisited. However, after some experimentation I decided not to include these experimentations in the project since they did not yield any new
insights.
